    <h1 class="title">Why 03 inspires me</h1>

    <div class="row">
<div class="col-4">
<p>03 greedo is a inspiration to me because he overcame so much adversity and never let anyone talk him out of what he wanted.
    He knew he had a talent and he knew that he wanted to be a musician. He continued to work relentlessly, even after years of getting very little 
    recognition for years he continued to work hard until it eventually paid off and he signed a major record deal. He had a tough upbringing, becoming addicted to multiple 
    substances early on in his life and losing many friends. He sings about it in songs such as "Substance", "Loaded", "Mafia Business" and "Never Bend"
</p>




</div>
<div class="col-4">
<p>Even after being hit with a 20 year sentence just months after signing a major deal and blowing up. He continued to release prolifically and 
    keep his fans invested. He never gave up and never sold out. He preaches authenticity and being real. He has helped me overcome many obstacles 
    in life by reminding me that no matter how bad the circumstances, you can always work hard enough to get out of it. He never had a formal 
    music education and always speaks on how making music is a personal art and their shouldnt be all these rules. He also supports making your own instrumentals
    He was released from prison recently and is hoping to begin releasing again soon!
